## MetaManager track

Starts tracking a path (local or Google Drive)

### Synopsis

Starts tracking a file/folder or whole tree.

Local paths:
  track "/home/dev/project"
  track "/home/dev/project*"   (recursive; use quotes)

Google Drive (run "PathTracer login" first):
  track "gdrive:/"             (root of My Drive)
  track "gdrive:/Folder"
  track "gdrive:/Folder/Sub*"  (recursive)

With context set to gdrive, you can also use:
  track "/Folder"   or   track "/Folder*"

After "gdrive cd /SomeFolder", relative paths use that directory:
  track .   track SubFolder   track SubFolder*

Subcommands:
  track show   show tracked nodes from current directory (local or gdrive cwd)

```
MetaManager track [flags]

### Options

  -h, --help   help for track
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -d, --debug   enable debug logging
```
